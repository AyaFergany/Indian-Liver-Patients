## About Dataset

This data set contains 416 liver patient records and 167 non-liver patient records collected from North East of Andhra Pradesh, India. The “Dataset” column is a class label used to divide groups into a liver patient (liver disease) or not (no disease). This data set contains 441 male patient records and 142 female patient records.

Note: We have not started any data analysis yet, this is just to show you all the authenticity of the dataset.

Problem statement
By using these patient records to determine which patients have liver disease and which ones do not.

Data description
Any patient whose age exceeded 89 is listed as being of age “90”.

Columns:

Age of the patient
Gender of the patient
Total Bilirubin
Bilirubin is an orange-yellow pigment that occurs normally when part of your red blood cells break down. A bilirubin test measures the amount of bilirubin in your blood. It’s used to help find the cause of health conditions like jaundice, anemia, and liver disease.

Direct Bilirubin
Bilirubin attached by the liver to glucuronic acid, a glucose-derived acid, is called direct or conjugated, bilirubin. Bilirubin not attached to glucuronic acid is called indirect

Alkaline Phosphatase
Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) is an enzyme in a person’s blood that helps break down proteins. Using an ALP test, it is possible to measure how much of this enzyme is circulating in a person’s blood.

Alamine Aminotransferase
Alanine aminotransferase (ALT) is an enzyme found primarily in the liver and kidney. ALT is increased with liver damage and is used to screen for and/or monitor liver disease.

Aspartate Aminotransferase
AST (aspartate aminotransferase) is an enzyme that is found mostly in the liver, but also in muscles. When your liver is damaged, it releases AST into your bloodstream. An AST blood test measures the amount of AST in your blood. The test can help your health care provider diagnose liver damage or disease.

Total Proteins
Albumin and globulin are two types of protein in your body. The total protein test measures the total amount of albumin and globulin in your body.

Albumin
Albumin and Globulin Ratio
“Dataset” field is used to split the data into two sets (patient with liver disease, or no disease).
